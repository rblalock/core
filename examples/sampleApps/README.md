Sample Apps
===============
These are sample apps and tests using the core.js singleton.  These are meant to demonstrate
the different ways an app can utilize core.js, various navigation patterns, etc.

We made it easy to run these all in one Ti project.  In root project, open `/app/config.json`
and change the name of the `"examples"` property to the example you want to run.

e.g. Change the name to "simple" to run the simple sample app.
