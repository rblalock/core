Example Studio App
===============
We made it easy to run these examples all in one Ti project.  First, import this app in to Studio,
then in the root project, open `/app/config.json` and change the name of the `"examples"`
property to the example you want to run.

e.g. Change the name to "simple" to run the simple sample app.
