Standard, Native Navigation Example
===============
This example uses the standard navigation architectures for Android and iOS.
e.g. NavigationWindow for iOS and the ActionBar for Android.

This is a simple example of handling opening new windows in a cross platform
fashion.  If you want to manage the stack yourself, do things like close all
windows, etc. Reference some of the other examples on managing your own
stack of views or windows.  Those examples can be mixed here with the concept below.
